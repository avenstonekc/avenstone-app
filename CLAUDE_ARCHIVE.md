## lidar-phase1 · 2026-04-15 · LiDAR Phase 1 on-device confirmation + scan persistence

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: CORRECTION — AiIntakeWizard was claimed to support LiDAR toggle but never did. Completely rewrote as pure LiDAR scanning flow — removed AI chat step, manual grid, review/submit step, lead creation. New wizard is a thin wrapper rendering LidarScanner fullscreen.
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/components/ai/AiIntakeWizard.jsx (full rewrite), src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (fixed async isLidarSupported bug)
- Decision: Path A — scanned rooms held in local state only for now. Lead creation + save-to-job return in a later phase.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: Phase 1 LiDAR confirmed on iPhone 17 Pro. Locked LiDAR roadmap Phases 2-4.
- Decision: Scans attach to contacts first (not jobs directly). Phase 2 = continuous multi-room session (~1,500 sqft limit). Phase 4 = wing editor + GPS-anchored stitching.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: LiDAR scan persistence shipped — scans attach to jobs (FloorPlanTab) and contacts (ContactsScr)
- Files: supabase.js (+sbSaveJobLidarScan, sbGetJobLidarScans, sbSaveLidarScan, sbGetContactLidarScans), FloorPlanTab.jsx (new), ContactsScr.jsx (+floor plans card), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (+jobId prop)
- Decision: Both tables use TEXT FK (not UUID) — contacts.id and jobs.id are TEXT type. FK constraint on UUID type would fail.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: AI PM Dashboard built — owner-only, 30-day nightly alert history with stat cards and alert breakdown
- Files: components/dashboard/AiPmDashboard.jsx (new), App.jsx (+nav item + render, owner-only)

## sub-portal-gap-analysis · 2026-04-15 · Sub portal gap analysis

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: Sub portal upgrade gap analysis — PM-Sub direct chat, phase confirmation, CO submission are all missing
- Decision: Sub AI companion replaced with PM-Sub direct chat concept. Phase confirmation (mark started/complete) and sub CO submission spec'd but not built.
- Open: Sub phase buttons (Mark Started / Mark Complete) may silently fail on device if RLS doesn't allow sub UPDATE on job_phases — one-line migration fix if needed.

## capture-v2 · 2026-04-19 · Capture v2: GPS, exterior AR, mandatory height, quality meter

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 1 shipped — CaptureMode enum, expanded data model, GPS stamping
- Files: src/lib/gps.js (new), supabase.js (sbSaveJobLidarScan + sbSaveLidarScan updated), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (GPS wired in), Info.plist (NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription)
- DB: job_lidar_scans + contact_lidar_scans both get 10 new nullable columns: capture_mode (default 'interior'), height_meters, height_source, height_points[], gps_latitude, gps_longitude, gps_accuracy, quality_score, quality_grade, quality_deductions (JSONB)

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 2 shipped — Exterior Mode AR capture (ARKit, not RoomPlan — LiDAR fails outdoors)
- Files: ExteriorScanViewController.swift (new), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (+startExteriorScan), src/lib/lidar.js (+startExteriorScan), LidarScanner.jsx (mode toggle), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (exterior save paths), FloorPlanTab.jsx (exterior scan card)
- Decision: Tap corners → gold spheres + cylinder lines. Shoelace formula for area. Long press to drag corners. outline_data JSONB column stores result. capture_mode='exterior' distinguishes in UI.

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 3 shipped — mandatory height capture on all captures, both modes
- Files: src/components/ai/HeightCaptureStep.jsx (new — shared confirm/override UI), ExteriorScanViewController.swift (height phase after polygon Done, groundY from corner average, tap-to-raycast), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (added 'height' step, all save paths include height fields), FloorPlanTab.jsx (amber 'Height missing' badge on legacy records)
- Decision: Interior autoHeightFt = max of room.height values. Height is mandatory — Confirm disabled until valid. No skip path.

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 4 shipped — quality meter 0-100, live bar in Swift VCs, post-capture report in React
- Files: CaptureQualityTracker.swift (new — shared scoring class), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (live quality bar), ExteriorScanViewController.swift (live bar), src/components/ai/CaptureQualityReport.jsx (new — score/deductions/Re-scan+Accept), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (added 'report' step)
- Decision: Interior live bar = duration-based (20→90 over 60s). Final score from CapturedRoom (wall count, confidence, ceiling, duration, area). Aggregate quality = average of per-room scores. Quality saves regardless of Re-scan or Accept.

## apr22-cleanup-pdf · 2026-04-22 · CLAUDE.md reconciliation + fixture/object export

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Reconciled CLAUDE.md Priority Order and Done list against actual shipped code
- Files: CLAUDE.md (Priority Order + Done section rewritten, model string updated to claude-opus-4-7)
- Decision: Priority Order: fixtures/objects export → PDF dimension overhaul → LiDAR Phase 4 wing editor → sub portal upgrades → white-label wizard → lien waivers

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Fixtures/objects export shipped — Swift serialization + JS PDF rendering
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift (+fixtureCategoryString, +objectSegs loop in roomToDict and structureToRooms), src/lib/pdf.js (+FIXTURE_LABELS, +_drawFixture, +render loop)
- Decision: fixtureCategoryString uses if-equality (not switch) — CapturedRoom.Object.Category is a struct, not an enum.
- Decision: Render 9 categories (toilet, bathtub, sink, stove, oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, washerDryer, storage). Skip furniture + unknown. Confidence .low skipped.
- Decision: Single-room path objects exported from Swift but NOT rendered in JS PDF yet — _processWalls rotates rooms for layout but object coords from roomToDict are in unrotated ARKit space. Rotation transform deferred to Phase 2.
- Open: Single-room fixture rendering requires passing rotation angle from _processWalls to _drawFixture.

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Track B architecture review + full codebase cleanup + sub portal and PDF features shipped
- Files (cleanup): deleted lib/ai.js, lib/captureTypes.js, App.css, src/styles/, dead assets. Renamed SubOnboardingModal → SubComplianceModal. Centralized hardcoded Supabase URLs across 10 files into supabase.js.
- Files (pdf.js): Proper architectural dimension lines replacing W×D bounding-box text. _drawDimLine helper with extension lines, tick marks, outward-normal offset. W×D label removed from centroid.
- Files (sub portal): supabase.js (+sbSubUpdatePhase, +sbSubSubmitCO), SubJobView.jsx (Mark Started/Complete buttons, CO submission form).
- Decision: AV_JOBS / setGlobalJobs kept — FormScr.jsx uses AV_JOBS for job picker. Not dead.
- Decision: ConsultationTab split and LidarScanner split rejected as premature — only worth doing when a feature forces us back in.

## apr23-playwright-bugs · 2026-04-23 · Playwright fixes + ContractModal + Codemagic

[LOG — 2026-04-23]
- Action: Fixed Playwright Step 8 flaky test + ContractModal iOS "Load failed" + ClientPortal contract banner + codemagic.yaml Beta Review bug
- Files: tests/portals-e2e.spec.js (reactFill() + waitForTimeout(2500) for sbNotify DB write), ContractModal.jsx (signed_url || file_url), ClientPortal.jsx (contract banner), codemagic.yaml (submit_to_testflight: false)
- Decision: page.fill() doesn't reliably trigger React onChange on controlled inputs — always use reactFill() helper in tests.
- Decision: proposalDoc.file_url is raw storage path; inside Capacitor webview resolves to localhost — use signed_url.
- Decision: submit_to_testflight: true with no beta_groups triggers Beta App Review. Internal testers only — set false.

## apr23-pdf-naming · 2026-04-23 · Multi-room naming off-by-one + 5 PDF improvements

[LOG — 2026-04-23]
- Action: Fixed multi-room LiDAR room-name off-by-one bug + 5 floor plan PDF renderer improvements
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift (removed between-scan room picker, all N names entered at end with sqft hints)
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (feet-inches format 5'-6", perimeter-only dim lines, door arc cap, 3-tier wall weights, _drawFixture icon rewrite)
- Decision: Root cause of off-by-one — StructureBuilder returns rooms in spatial order (not scan order). Fix: one naming screen at the end, no mid-session picker.
- Decision: Wall weights: exterior 2.5pt, interior/shared 1.5pt, door/window 0.5pt. Uses midCount map to classify.
- Open: Verify perimeter-only dim lines on device — depends on StructureBuilder returning shared walls in both adjacent room lists.

## pdf-renderer-rewrite · 2026-04-24 · Full architectural floor plan PDF rewrite

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Professional PDF renderer rewrite — full architectural floor plan, multi-floor support, poché walls, world-mode vs packing-mode layout, polygon centroid labels, graduated scale bar
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (full rewrite: added _groupByFloor, _dedupFeatures, _segsToPolyPoints, _polyCentroid, _pointInPoly, _interiorPoint, _drawPoché, _eraseGap, _dimLine, _drawScaleBar, _renderFloorPage, _renderSummaryPage; removed FIXTURE_LABELS/_drawFixture), src/lib/captureTypes.js (re-created: FLOOR_LABELS, floorLabel — was deleted 2026-04-22)
- Decision: Fixture rendering deliberately removed. Single-room path requires rotation transform from _processWalls that doesn't exist yet. Deferred to next phase.
- Decision: Landscape orientation (792×612pt) for floor plan pages; summary page stays portrait.
- Decision: World-mode (has worldX/worldZ) → _processAllRooms + spatial layout. Single-room fallback → _processWalls packing layout.
- Open: Fixture rendering pending — Swift already serializes room.objects; PDF needs _drawFixture reinstated with correct rotation transform.

## lidar-multifloor · 2026-04-24 · Multi-floor scan flow end-to-end

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Multi-floor scan flow wired end-to-end — captureTypes.js, floorIndex JS→Swift→rooms, floor picker screen in LidarScanner
- Files: src/lib/captureTypes.js (FLOOR_LABELS, floorLabel), src/lib/lidar.js (scanMultipleRooms(floorIndex), simulation rooms tagged with floor field), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (floorIndex from JS call → vc.floorIndex → "floor" in room dicts), src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (FloorPicker component, FLOOR_OPTIONS, computeNextFloor, pendingFloorIndex state), CLAUDE.md (+commit-and-push Working Preference bullet)
- Decision: Floor picker skipped on first scan (rooms empty) — auto-uses floor 0. Shown before every subsequent scan. Auto-selects next unscanned floor.
- Decision: FLOOR_LABELS: -1=Basement, 0=1st Floor, 1=2nd Floor, 2=3rd Floor, 3=4th Floor. Legacy rooms without floor field default to 0.
