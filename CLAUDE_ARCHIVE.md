## lidar-phase1 · 2026-04-15 · LiDAR Phase 1 on-device confirmation + scan persistence

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: CORRECTION — AiIntakeWizard was claimed to support LiDAR toggle but never did. Completely rewrote as pure LiDAR scanning flow — removed AI chat step, manual grid, review/submit step, lead creation. New wizard is a thin wrapper rendering LidarScanner fullscreen.
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/components/ai/AiIntakeWizard.jsx (full rewrite), src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (fixed async isLidarSupported bug)
- Decision: Path A — scanned rooms held in local state only for now. Lead creation + save-to-job return in a later phase.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: Phase 1 LiDAR confirmed on iPhone 17 Pro. Locked LiDAR roadmap Phases 2-4.
- Decision: Scans attach to contacts first (not jobs directly). Phase 2 = continuous multi-room session (~1,500 sqft limit). Phase 4 = wing editor + GPS-anchored stitching.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: LiDAR scan persistence shipped — scans attach to jobs (FloorPlanTab) and contacts (ContactsScr)
- Files: supabase.js (+sbSaveJobLidarScan, sbGetJobLidarScans, sbSaveLidarScan, sbGetContactLidarScans), FloorPlanTab.jsx (new), ContactsScr.jsx (+floor plans card), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (+jobId prop)
- Decision: Both tables use TEXT FK (not UUID) — contacts.id and jobs.id are TEXT type. FK constraint on UUID type would fail.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: AI PM Dashboard built — owner-only, 30-day nightly alert history with stat cards and alert breakdown
- Files: components/dashboard/AiPmDashboard.jsx (new), App.jsx (+nav item + render, owner-only)

---

## sub-portal-gap-analysis · 2026-04-15 · Sub portal gap analysis

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: Sub portal upgrade gap analysis — PM-Sub direct chat, phase confirmation, CO submission are all missing
- Decision: Sub AI companion replaced with PM-Sub direct chat concept. Phase confirmation (mark started/complete) and sub CO submission spec'd but not built.
- Open: Sub phase buttons (Mark Started / Mark Complete) may silently fail on device if RLS doesn't allow sub UPDATE on job_phases — one-line migration fix if needed.

---

## capture-v2 · 2026-04-19 · Capture v2: GPS, exterior AR, mandatory height, quality meter

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 1 shipped — CaptureMode enum, expanded data model, GPS stamping
- Files: src/lib/gps.js (new), supabase.js (sbSaveJobLidarScan + sbSaveLidarScan updated), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (GPS wired in), Info.plist (NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription)
- DB: job_lidar_scans + contact_lidar_scans both get 10 new nullable columns: capture_mode (default 'interior'), height_meters, height_source, height_points[], gps_latitude, gps_longitude, gps_accuracy, quality_score, quality_grade, quality_deductions (JSONB)

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 2 shipped — Exterior Mode AR capture (ARKit, not RoomPlan — LiDAR fails outdoors)
- Files: ExteriorScanViewController.swift (new), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (+startExteriorScan), src/lib/lidar.js (+startExteriorScan), LidarScanner.jsx (mode toggle), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (exterior save paths), FloorPlanTab.jsx (exterior scan card)
- Decision: Tap corners → gold spheres + cylinder lines. Shoelace formula for area. Long press to drag corners. outline_data JSONB column stores result. capture_mode='exterior' distinguishes in UI.

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 3 shipped — mandatory height capture on all captures, both modes
- Files: src/components/ai/HeightCaptureStep.jsx (new — shared confirm/override UI), ExteriorScanViewController.swift (height phase after polygon Done, groundY from corner average, tap-to-raycast), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (added 'height' step, all save paths include height fields), FloorPlanTab.jsx (amber 'Height missing' badge on legacy records)
- Decision: Interior autoHeightFt = max of room.height values. Height is mandatory — Confirm disabled until valid. No skip path.

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 4 shipped — quality meter 0-100, live bar in Swift VCs, post-capture report in React
- Files: CaptureQualityTracker.swift (new — shared scoring class), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (live quality bar), ExteriorScanViewController.swift (live bar), src/components/ai/CaptureQualityReport.jsx (new — score/deductions/Re-scan+Accept), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (added 'report' step)
- Decision: Interior live bar = duration-based (20→90 over 60s). Final score from CapturedRoom (wall count, confidence, ceiling, duration, area). Aggregate quality = average of per-room scores. Quality saves regardless of Re-scan or Accept.

## apr22-cleanup-pdf · 2026-04-22 · CLAUDE.md reconciliation + fixture/object export

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Reconciled CLAUDE.md Priority Order and Done list against actual shipped code
- Files: CLAUDE.md (Priority Order + Done section rewritten, model string updated to claude-opus-4-7)
- Decision: Priority Order: fixtures/objects export → PDF dimension overhaul → LiDAR Phase 4 wing editor → sub portal upgrades → white-label wizard → lien waivers

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Fixtures/objects export shipped — Swift serialization + JS PDF rendering
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift (+fixtureCategoryString, +objectSegs loop in roomToDict and structureToRooms), src/lib/pdf.js (+FIXTURE_LABELS, +_drawFixture, +render loop)
- Decision: fixtureCategoryString uses if-equality (not switch) — CapturedRoom.Object.Category is a struct, not an enum.
- Decision: Render 9 categories (toilet, bathtub, sink, stove, oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, washerDryer, storage). Skip furniture + unknown. Confidence .low skipped.
- Decision: Single-room path objects exported from Swift but NOT rendered in JS PDF yet — _processWalls rotates rooms for layout but object coords from roomToDict are in unrotated ARKit space. Rotation transform deferred to Phase 2.
- Open: Single-room fixture rendering requires passing rotation angle from _processWalls to _drawFixture.

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Track B architecture review + full codebase cleanup + sub portal and PDF features shipped
- Files (cleanup): deleted lib/ai.js, lib/captureTypes.js, App.css, src/styles/, dead assets. Renamed SubOnboardingModal → SubComplianceModal. Centralized hardcoded Supabase URLs across 10 files into supabase.js.
- Files (pdf.js): Proper architectural dimension lines replacing W×D bounding-box text. _drawDimLine helper with extension lines, tick marks, outward-normal offset. W×D label removed from centroid.
- Files (sub portal): supabase.js (+sbSubUpdatePhase, +sbSubSubmitCO), SubJobView.jsx (Mark Started/Complete buttons, CO submission form).
- Decision: AV_JOBS / setGlobalJobs kept — FormScr.jsx uses AV_JOBS for job picker. Not dead.
- Decision: ConsultationTab split and LidarScanner split rejected as premature — only worth doing when a feature forces us back in.

---

## apr23-playwright-bugs · 2026-04-23 · Playwright fixes + ContractModal + Codemagic

[LOG — 2026-04-23]
- Action: Fixed Playwright Step 8 flaky test + ContractModal iOS "Load failed" + ClientPortal contract banner + codemagic.yaml Beta Review bug
- Files: tests/portals-e2e.spec.js (reactFill() + waitForTimeout(2500) for sbNotify DB write), ContractModal.jsx (signed_url || file_url), ClientPortal.jsx (contract banner), codemagic.yaml (submit_to_testflight: false)
- Decision: page.fill() doesn't reliably trigger React onChange on controlled inputs — always use reactFill() helper in tests.
- Decision: proposalDoc.file_url is raw storage path; inside Capacitor webview resolves to localhost — use signed_url.
- Decision: submit_to_testflight: true with no beta_groups triggers Beta App Review. Internal testers only — set false.

## apr23-pdf-naming · 2026-04-23 · Multi-room naming off-by-one + 5 PDF improvements

[LOG — 2026-04-23]
- Action: Fixed multi-room LiDAR room-name off-by-one bug + 5 floor plan PDF renderer improvements
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift (removed between-scan room picker, all N names entered at end with sqft hints)
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (feet-inches format 5'-6", perimeter-only dim lines, door arc cap, 3-tier wall weights, _drawFixture icon rewrite)
- Decision: Root cause of off-by-one — StructureBuilder returns rooms in spatial order (not scan order). Fix: one naming screen at the end, no mid-session picker.
- Decision: Wall weights: exterior 2.5pt, interior/shared 1.5pt, door/window 0.5pt. Uses midCount map to classify.
- Open: Verify perimeter-only dim lines on device — depends on StructureBuilder returning shared walls in both adjacent room lists.

---

## pdf-renderer-rewrite · 2026-04-24 · Full architectural floor plan PDF rewrite

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Professional PDF renderer rewrite — full architectural floor plan, multi-floor support, poché walls, world-mode vs packing-mode layout, polygon centroid labels, graduated scale bar
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (full rewrite: added _groupByFloor, _dedupFeatures, _segsToPolyPoints, _polyCentroid, _pointInPoly, _interiorPoint, _drawPoché, _eraseGap, _dimLine, _drawScaleBar, _renderFloorPage, _renderSummaryPage; removed FIXTURE_LABELS/_drawFixture), src/lib/captureTypes.js (re-created: FLOOR_LABELS, floorLabel — was deleted 2026-04-22)
- Decision: Fixture rendering deliberately removed. Single-room path requires rotation transform from _processWalls that doesn't exist yet. Deferred to next phase.
- Decision: Landscape orientation (792×612pt) for floor plan pages; summary page stays portrait.
- Decision: World-mode (has worldX/worldZ) → _processAllRooms + spatial layout. Single-room fallback → _processWalls packing layout.
- Open: Fixture rendering pending — Swift already serializes room.objects; PDF needs _drawFixture reinstated with correct rotation transform.

---

## lidar-multifloor · 2026-04-24 · Multi-floor scan flow end-to-end

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Multi-floor scan flow wired end-to-end — captureTypes.js, floorIndex JS→Swift→rooms, floor picker screen in LidarScanner
- Files: src/lib/captureTypes.js (FLOOR_LABELS, floorLabel), src/lib/lidar.js (scanMultipleRooms(floorIndex), simulation rooms tagged with floor field), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (floorIndex from JS call → vc.floorIndex → "floor" in room dicts), src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (FloorPicker component, FLOOR_OPTIONS, computeNextFloor, pendingFloorIndex state), CLAUDE.md (+commit-and-push Working Preference bullet)
- Decision: Floor picker skipped on first scan (rooms empty) — auto-uses floor 0. Shown before every subsequent scan. Auto-selects next unscanned floor.
- Decision: FLOOR_LABELS: -1=Basement, 0=1st Floor, 1=2nd Floor, 2=3rd Floor, 3=4th Floor. Legacy rooms without floor field default to 0.

---

## pdf-13bug-sweep · 2026-04-24 · 13-bug PDF sweep

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: 13-bug PDF cleanup sweep (Bugs 1–13) — architectural floor plan renderer polish across pdf.js and RoomPlanPlugin.swift
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (13 commits), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (Bug 7 — polygon containment name matching)
- Decision: Bug 2 — interior wall classification replaced: 3-condition test (midpoint ≤0.5ft + length ±15% + direction |dot|≥0.9) instead of midpoint-only quantized grid. Eliminates false bathroom interior dim.
- Decision: Bug 7 — Swift name match: wall endpoints sorted by angle from centroid → polygon; pointInPolygon as primary; nearest-centroid fallback with [LIDAR_WARN] log.
- Decision: Overall bounding dims (top + right) at off=62, lw=1.0 — heavier than per-wall dims (off=44, lw=0.75).
- Decision: Title block moved to left-side vertical column (TC_W=108pt). Plan area now 536×476pt inside DL=168/DR=704/DT=82/DB=558.
- Decision: Overall HEIGHT dim on RIGHT side — left side is blocked by title column.

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Second PDF + scanner cleanup sweep — Bugs 1–10 (commits 4f46f29 through f517802)
- Files: src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (Bug 1), src/lib/pdf.js (Bugs 2–10)

**Audit findings:**
- Bug 1 (floor picker not firing): ListPhase was calling onStartMultiRoomScan(0) directly when rooms.length===0, bypassing FloorPicker. Also computeNextFloor iterated [-1,0,1,2,3] so empty rooms defaulted to Basement. Fix: always route through onOpenFloorPicker; reordered preference to [0,1,2,3,-1].
- Bug 3 (landscape): jsPDF({ format: [792,612] }) without explicit orientation was being interpreted inconsistently. Fix: orientation:'landscape' + format:'letter'.
- Bug 7 (duplicate dims): Two exterior segs from different rooms with slightly different outward-normal normalizations gave different `dist` values, causing the placedDims dedup to miss them. Resolved by chain-dim rewrite — per-edge grouping dedupes by midpoint proximity (0.3 ft) before rendering.
- Bug 8 (TOTAL row): gTotPerim and gTotWallArea were never declared at global scope (only floor-level fTotPerim/fTotWallArea existed). TOTAL row hardcoded '—' for all three. Fix: added global accumulators, wired roll-up, ceiling total = floor area total.
- Bug 10 (openings): Openings loop already correct — erase only, no swing arc. Walk-through rendered with swing arc = RoomPlan sensor tagged it as CapturedRoom.Door, not Opening. Render-side fix not applicable. Flagged as known limitation; user-editable override deferred.

**Key decisions:**
- Chain dims (Bug 5): MagicPlan style — one dim line per edge (top/bottom/right), single label per segment centered on span, tick marks at each boundary, overall outer tier at +38pt. Left edge skipped (title column).
- Bug 4 (left-edge overlap into title column): Resolved by omitting left chain entirely.
- Bug 2 (orthogonal snap): _snapToOrtho runs on a deep clone before _processAllRooms. Angle snap (5° tolerance) + endpoint merge (2-inch tolerance). Raw data preserved.
- Bug 6 (label collision): _renderChainDims returns label bounding boxes; room labels check dimBoxes + previously placed room label boxes before rendering. Falls back to interior point, then font reduction 10%, then [LIDAR_WARN].
- Bug 9 (garage door): ri preserved on door objects via byRoom() to look up room name. Width ≥6ft + /garage/i room name → overhead-door symbol (two parallel lines + inward arrow). Width 4–6ft non-garage → bi-fold unchanged. <4ft → swing arc unchanged.

**Known remaining limitations:**
- RoomPlan misclassification of walk-through openings as doors (Bug 10 — sensor-side, not render-side)
- Fixture/object rendering still pending rotation transform (_drawFixture not yet reinstated)
- Single-room (non-world-mode) path: chain dims not applied (still uses old per-seg _dimLine calls)

## pdf-dimboxes-crash · 2026-04-24/26 · PDF silent crash fix

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: PDF generation bug fixed — silent crash on tap "Generate PDF" across commits 4f46f29–f517802
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/lib/pdf.js
- Decision: Root cause — `_renderChainDims` line 551 returned `undefined` instead of `[]` when `kept` (post-dedup segment array) was empty. Callers spread the return value (`..._renderChainDims(...)`); spreading `undefined` threw a TypeError that silently killed the render with no user-visible error. Fix: `return;` → `return [];`.
- Decision: Added try/catch wrapping all of `buildFloorPlanPDF` — `console.error('[LIDAR_PDF_ERROR]', e)` + `alert()` with message on failure. User now sees an error instead of silence.
- Decision: Added `[LIDAR_PDF_STAGE]` breadcrumbs at: start, groupByFloor, doc created, per-floor page (with floor name), snapToOrtho, processAllRooms, chain dims, room labels, summary page, complete. Use Safari Web Inspector / Xcode console to read these on device.
- Open: Awaiting `[LIDAR_PDF_ERROR]` / `[LIDAR_PDF_STAGE]` output from next user scan to confirm fix held or identify any secondary crash path.
- Next: If PDF renders cleanly — proceed to scope-and-allowance engine schema design.

[LOG — 2026-04-26]
- Action: Floor plan PDF crash fixed — "Can't find variable: dimBoxes" alert on device.
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/lib/pdf.js
- Decision: ROOT — dimBoxes was declared `const` inside the `if (worldMode)` block at line 1010 but referenced at line 1063 outside it. Hoisted to `let dimBoxes = []` at outer scope before the if/else; assignment inside worldMode branch unchanged.
- Open: Verify on iPhone after Vercel + Codemagic deploys. Single-room PDF path still doesn't get chain dims (pre-existing limitation, not regression).
- Next: Multi-room PDF on real scan → confirm fixtures still pending → tackle room-name-backwards UX bug.

## takeoff-scope-design-audits · 2026-04-24–25 · Read-only audits: material takeoff + scope-and-allowance engine

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Read-only audit — Material Takeoff Wizard design. Covered 6 areas: scan data shape, pdf.js takeoff math, AI estimate flow, ai_knowledge pricing, estimate_line_items schema, MaterialSelectionScr.
- Files: None changed (read-only audit)
- Decision: MaterialSelectionScr (950 lines) is not a foundation — it writes to jobs.intake_answers only, uses hardcoded formulas, not connected to scan data or estimate_line_items. Start fresh.
- Decision: `generate-estimate-from-session` IS reachable from UI — ConsultationTab calls it from the "Generate Estimate" button. It does NOT write estimate_line_items; caller (ConsultationTab.saveEstimate) handles persistence. [Corrected: prior claim of "orphaned" was wrong.]
- Decision: estimate_line_items schema is well-designed (quantity + unit + unit_cost → generated total_cost + client_price). Zero rows in production — ready to receive takeoff output.
- Decision: ai_knowledge has 21 total entries — 15 pricing/rule, 6 narrative. All active. Content is structured prose with $ ranges, regex-extractable but not machine-readable JSON. [Corrected: prior claim of "8 entries" was wrong.]
- Decision: Recommended build path — (1) extract computeTakeoff(rooms) from pdf.js, (2) generateLineItems(takeoff, selections) → estimate_line_items rows, (3) wizard UI room-by-room material selection, (4) summary + estimate PDF.
- Next: Build Material Takeoff Wizard starting with Phase 1 (data extraction layer)

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Read-only audit — Scope-and-allowance engine design. Second audit expanding on first. Covered: consultation_sessions/extractions/measurements schema, session write flow, consultation↔scan join, generate-estimate-from-session full code, ai-estimator full code, their difference, callEstimator existence check, estimate_line_items extension surface, MaterialSelectionScr deep read, ai_knowledge full dump + machine-readability, change_orders schema, upgrade-CO column gap analysis.
- Files: None changed (read-only audit)
- Decision: consultation_sessions + job_lidar_scans share only job_id — NO structural join. Two parallel data pools.
- Decision: generate-estimate-from-session IS reachable from UI (ConsultationTab). Previous session's audit was wrong about it being orphaned. It's called from "Generate Estimate" button.
- Decision: ai-estimator (EstimateTab chat) and generate-estimate-from-session (ConsultationTab measure flow) serve different stages — not redundant.
- Decision: estimate_line_items has NO allowance column, NO scan_id, NO template_id. notes (TEXT) is the only free extension field. Full replace-all write pattern via sbSaveEstimateLineItems.
- Decision: MaterialSelectionScr is hardcoded bathroom-only with picsum photos. APPROX_QTY is static (tile=200sf regardless of scan). buildEstimate() uses fixed per-sqft ratios. Writes to jobs.intake_answers only. Dead code — not imported anywhere.
- Decision: ai_knowledge pricing entries are machine-parseable prose ranges (regex extractable), not JSON. 15 pricing/rule entries, 6 narrative entries. All active. Mid-range formula: (low+high)/2.
- Decision: change_orders has no FK to estimate_line_items. No allowance_original, no estimate_line_item_id, no auto_generated, no client_approved_at, no source_type. All 6 would be needed for auto-CO from client upgrade selection.
- Open: ai_knowledge pricing entries need a parsing pass or a new structured pricing_lookup table before they can be used as machine-readable unit costs in a takeoff engine.
- Next: Design scope-and-allowance engine schema (new tables: scan_takeoff, allowance_line_items or estimate_line_items extension, upgrade_selections) before writing any code.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Read-only audit delivered — scope-and-allowance engine (second audit, full briefing). All 6 areas covered and reported to user.
- Files: None changed (read-only audit)
- Decision: Briefing confirmed — consultation↔scan join is job_id only (no structural link). generate-estimate-from-session IS reachable from UI. estimate_line_items has no allowance/scan/template columns. MaterialSelectionScr writes to jobs.intake_answers only, not imported anywhere. ai_knowledge has 15 pricing entries (regex-parseable prose ranges) + 6 narrative. change_orders needs 6 new columns for auto-CO flow: estimate_line_item_id, allowance_original, allowance_override, source_type, auto_generated, client_approved_at.

## vision-doc-updates · 2026-04-25 · AVENSTONE_VISION.md updates

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: AVENSTONE_VISION.md updated — 11 targeted edits adding multi-owner model, AI-seeded inspection checklists, expanded moat section, and cost guardrail rule.
- Files: AVENSTONE_VISION.md
- Decision: (a) Multi-owner model — all owners equivalent, first-to-approve wins on CO/knowledge/contract actions. No second signature. Each owner gets their own morning brief.
- Decision: (b) Per-user briefings are not consolidated — each user sees a brief based on their own job touches, not a shared owner dashboard.
- Decision: (c) Inspection checklists — AI-seeded baseline (one Sonnet call, 60-80 entries, owner approves before activation). v2 ai_knowledge_learner edge function suggests new entries from completed job patterns; owner approves each addition. inspection_checklist open question closed — decision made.
- Decision: (d) Moat section expanded with three durable advantages: runs the software it builds (uncopyable feedback loop), every job teaches the system (private dataset compounds), single-builder velocity (idea Mon → ship Fri).

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: AVENSTONE_VISION.md updated — white-label / multi-trade model added (Multi-trade section, v4+ section, fourth durable advantage in moat).
- Files: AVENSTONE_VISION.md
- Decision: Platform is multi-tenant from day one. v1 data model is trade-aware: ai_knowledge gets a trade tag, takeoff_templates include tenant_id + trade, phase definitions are per-tenant config, module visibility is a per-tenant feature flag set (manages_subs, uses_lidar, tracks_permits). Avenstone runs as a GC tenant with everything on — no trade-specific UIs needed in v1.
- Decision: v4+ expansion to other trades (painters, tile, roofers, etc.) is configuration and sales work, not engineering — if v1 data model is right, no rewrite needed.
- Decision: White-label-ready-from-day-one added as durable advantage #4 in moat section.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Multi-tenant / white-label model elevated to top-level architectural principle. Captured across CLAUDE.md (new "Multi-Tenant Architecture Rules" section), AVENSTONE_VISION.md (already done in prior commit), OPUS_PROMPT_RULES.md (new trade-aware-check rule), and FINANCIALS_PLAN.md (acknowledged compliant).
- Decision: Avenstone is the first tenant on a multi-tenant multi-trade platform. Every new schema includes tenant_id + RLS. Trade-specific data (pricing, checklists, templates, catalog) also includes a trade column. Phase definitions and module visibility are per-tenant config, not hardcoded. White-label expansion (v4+) is configuration work, not engineering work — provided v1-v3 hold this line.
- Files: CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE_MEMORY.md, OPUS_PROMPT_RULES.md, FINANCIALS_PLAN.md
- Open: confirm new client onboarding wizard (recently shipped per user) is tenant-aware and trade-aware — audit pending.
- Next: audit new client onboarding wizard, then resume scope-and-allowance v1 spec.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Stripped prompt wrapper from AVENSTONE_VISION.md — file now starts with "# Avenstone Vision — The Anti-Surprise Engine" instead of "SCOPE: create a new file...". All prior edits were correctly embedded inside the wrapper and are preserved in the clean file.
- Files: AVENSTONE_VISION.md
- Decision: Also updated "What's already shipped" bullet to reflect that disclosed unknowns in proposals has shipped (was still marked as a gap).

## disclosed-unknowns-pdf · 2026-04-25 · Disclosed COs in client proposal PDF

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Shipped disclosed change orders in client proposal PDF (first anti-surprise feature from AVENSTONE_VISION.md v1).
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/lib/pdf.js, avenstone-vite/src/lib/supabase.js, avenstone-vite/src/components/jobs/tabs/EstimateTab.jsx
- Decision: Section renders only when ≥1 oh_shit_moments row has included_in_proposal=true. Owner curates via "Disclosed unknowns" collapsible section in EstimateTab proposal modal — instant toggle, optimistic UI, persists to DB via sbToggleOhShitProposal. No schema changes — uses existing oh_shit_moments table as-is.
- Decision: Query by job_id (not session_id), include rows from all sessions. Owner curation is the filter. No deduplication by condition text (v2 concern).
- Decision: ConsultationTab's "Include in proposal" checkbox was in-memory only — it never wrote included_in_proposal=true to the DB. EstimateTab now provides the persistent toggle path.
- Open: change_orders ↔ oh_shit_moments linkage (disclosed_in_oh_shit_moment_id) deferred to v2 — when a real CO fires that matches a disclosed item, surface "as disclosed" to client.
- Next: use on next bid Avenstone sends. Observe client response. Decide v2 priorities from real use.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Fixed ConsultationTab oh_shit_moments toggle — now persists to DB via sbToggleOhShitProposal (was in-memory only).
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/components/jobs/tabs/ConsultationTab.jsx
- Decision: Two intentional curation surfaces: ConsultationTab (in-session, as unknowns surface during consultation) and EstimateTab (pre-send, when building the proposal PDF). Both write to oh_shit_moments.included_in_proposal. State is synchronized because both tabs read/write the same DB column.
- Decision: After generate-estimate-from-session returns, ConsultationTab now fetches the DB rows (with IDs) filtered by session_id, matches to API response rows by condition text, and keys ohShitToggled by DB UUID instead of array index. Toggle onChange does optimistic local update + sbToggleOhShitProposal call.
- Decision: Also fixed ConsultationTab display to use m.condition || m.title || m.issue (DB field name is `condition`, not `title`/`issue`) and m.estimated_cost_low/high (not m.cost_low/high).

## gap-analyzer · 2026-04-25 · AI consultation gap analyzer

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Consultation gap analyzer shipped — full pipeline from session end to gap review modal to estimate generation.
- Files: supabase/functions/ai-consultation-gap-analyzer/index.ts (new edge fn), supabase/migrations/20260425_consultation_gap_analyses.sql (new table), supabase.js (+GAP_ANALYZER_URL, +sbRunGapAnalysis, +sbLoadLatestGapAnalysis), generate-estimate-from-session/index.ts (+unresolved_gaps param), ConsultationTab.jsx (runGapAnalyzer, GapResolutionModal, gapRunning spinner, gaps reviewed badge)
- Decision: Haiku single shot, max_tokens 2048. Reads session + measurements + extraction + job + latest lidar scan + all active ai_knowledge. Returns up to 8 gaps (category, severity, title, description, suggested_action).
- Decision: After doneMeasuring or endSessionFromAmbient, runs gap analyzer before generateEstimate. If ≥1 gap returned → show GapResolutionModal. If 0 gaps → call generateEstimate([]) directly. If gap analyzer errors → fall through silently to generateEstimate([]).
- Decision: GapResolutionModal is full-screen overlay. Each gap has Resolved/Skip/Add note buttons. Generate estimate button disabled if any blocker is unresolved (no action taken). Unresolved gaps (not Resolved or Skip) passed to generate-estimate-from-session as unresolved_gaps.
- Decision: Unresolved gaps → oh_shit_moments: title→condition, description→how_to_present, severity (blocker→high, strong→medium, nice_to_have→low)→likelihood.
- Open: consultation_gap_analyses table must be applied to live DB via Supabase dashboard SQL editor (run 20260425_consultation_gap_analyses.sql). Edge fn auto-deployed via GitHub Actions.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Fixed three bugs surfaced during gap analyzer testing.
- Files: generate-estimate-from-session/index.ts, ai-consultation-gap-analyzer/index.ts, ConsultationTab.jsx
- Decision Bug 1: Removed `!measurements.length` hard guard from generate-estimate. Sessions where Haiku stays in "scoping" trade throughout (common in short sessions) produce zero consultation_measurements rows. Estimate now proceeds with whatever context is available; measureSummary notes when no measurements were recorded.
- Decision Bug 1 (also): Fixed `jobs.description` → `jobs.scope` in generate-estimate jobs query. `description` column does not exist on jobs table — PostgREST returned null for the entire row, making job=null → "Unknown" everywhere.
- Decision Bug 2: Added fire-and-forget ambient transcript flush at start of `startMeasuring()`. The 60-second interval is cleared immediately on mode transition; if ambient ran < 60 seconds, no extraction row was ever written. Now flushes transcript if ≥ 20 chars before clearing the interval.
- Decision Bug 3: Fixed same `description` → `scope` bug in gap analyzer jobs query and prompt.
- Note: PAT still expired — GitHub Actions edge fn deploys may be broken. User needs to regenerate PAT at supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens (No expiry) and run `gh secret set SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## doc-housekeeping · 2026-04-26 · CLAUDE.md trimmed + Opus/Sonnet delegation locked

[LOG — 2026-04-26]
- Action: Working model + priority order updated. Opus delegates easy tasks to Sonnet via copy-pasteable prompt; user runs Opus directly inside Claude Code (no more `/opus` relay).
- Files: CLAUDE.md (Diagnosis workflow section replaced with "Cost-aware delegation"; Priority Order #1 expanded with sub-bullets — fixtures, room-name-backwards bug, single-room parity)
- Decision: Triage rule — Opus for diagnosis/architecture/multi-system; Sonnet for scoped fixes/refactors/boilerplate. Prompt template documented in CLAUDE.md.
- Decision: LiDAR/PDF outranks website work in priority — if Kalin shows up with a LiDAR screenshot, drop everything. Website work continues in parallel, just behind it.

[LOG — 2026-04-26]
- Action: Trimmed CLAUDE.md from 696 lines to 514 lines.
- Files: CLAUDE.md
- Decision: Compressed 7 sections — folder tree (→ one paragraph), Core tables list (→ pointer to supabase.js + migrations/), edge function tables (→ 3 bullet lines), AI system ASCII diagram (→ 6 bullets with file paths), Opus/Sonnet dispatch template (→ pointer to OPUS_PROMPT_RULES.md), Done list (→ kept last 14 days, older items → pointer to CLAUDE_MEMORY.md), memory system (→ ~7 lines). Cross-references: AVENSTONE_VISION.md, OPUS_PROMPT_RULES.md, CLAUDE_MEMORY.md, FINANCIALS_PLAN.md confirmed as canonical homes for excised content.
- Open: Room-name-backwards bug (StructureBuilder returns rooms in spatial order, naming modal doesn't show which room is which). Fix proposed: thumbnail/centroid mini-map per room in naming list. Awaiting user OK to implement.

## sub-portal-phase-audit · 2026-04-26 · CO submitter audit + phase audit columns + inline CO edit

[LOG — 2026-04-26]
- Action: Sub portal upgrades — CO + phase audit shipped. Four-commit feature group covering submitter audit fields, sub-side approval/rejection notifications, phase start/complete audit columns, and inline CO edit for pending rows.
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/components/jobs/tabs/COTab.jsx, avenstone-vite/src/components/jobs/tabs/ScheduleTab.jsx, avenstone-vite/src/components/sub/SubJobView.jsx, avenstone-vite/src/lib/supabase.js, supabase/migrations/20260427_co_submitter_audit.sql, supabase/migrations/20260428_phase_audit.sql
- Commits: 1b815c2 (submitter audit + unified field shape), 6ce4482 (notify-sub on approve/reject), 0faa944 (phase audit columns), 53feba2 (inline CO edit)
- Decision: change_orders gains submitted_by_id (UUID FK profiles) + submitted_by_role (TEXT). sbSubSubmitCO renamed param title→description, auto-generates co_number via count query, stamps submitter. COTab renders cream pill "Submitted by ROLE" badge. SubJobView reads co.description with co.title fallback for legacy rows.
- Decision: New sbNotifyUser helper for targeted single-user bell notifications (vs broadcast sbNotify). apCO/rjCO call it with submitted_by_id when it differs from the acting PM — sub gets "CO #X approved/rejected" notification with amount + job address.
- Decision: job_phases gains started_at, started_by_id, completed_at, completed_by_id (all nullable). Stamped on first transition only. ScheduleTab loads profiles for all audit authors in one round-trip on mount, renders "Started [date] by [name]" / "Completed [date] by [name]" under each phase card. SubJobView shows date-only audit lines.
- Decision: COTab inline edit — pending rows get Edit button alongside Approve/Reject, swaps display for textarea + amount input pre-filled with current values. Approved/rejected COs remain read-only.
- Open: Both migrations (20260427, 20260428) need to be applied to live DB if not already auto-applied via GitHub Actions. Columns are nullable so deploy order doesn't matter.

## pdf-lidar-naming · 2026-04-26 · StructureBuilder restored + area-signature name match

[LOG — 2026-04-26]
- Action: Naming bug killed at root by removing post-scan matching layer.
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift, pdf.js
- Decision: Trust scan-time names — skip StructureBuilder + showNamingScreen + matchNamesToStructuredRooms. buildStructure() now calls fallbackRooms() directly and fires onComplete(.success). fallbackRooms() expanded to full dict parity with structureToRooms: doors/windows counts, doorSegments (with nx/nz/width), windowSegments, openingSegments, objects (category/dims/position/rotation/confidence), worldX/worldZ from global gMinX/gMinZ across all capturedRooms. Dead helpers left in file with DEAD CODE comments. Door swing arc cap reverted per Kalin's request — all swings drawn, original (80,80,80)/0.4pt stroke.
- Open: Without StructureBuilder, shared walls between rooms won't merge to a midline — adjacent rooms may render as parallel wall pairs separated by wall thickness. Chain dim dedup compensates on dimensions. If thick double-walls are visually unacceptable, re-introduce StructureBuilder behind a flag (but keep inline naming — the matching layer was the bug).

[LOG — 2026-04-26]
- Action: Fixed floor plan PDF logo rendering — correct 1:1 aspect ratio and JPEG format flag.
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/lib/pdf.js
- Decision: Logo asset (logo.png) is a 1024×1024 JPEG despite the .png extension. Previous implementation assumed 3:1 ratio and used 'PNG' format flag, producing a squished 48×16pt stamp. Fixed: title column uses 88×88pt square centered in the 108pt column (logoX=(TC_W-88)/2, logoY=12); summary page header uses 40×40pt at (M, 6). Both addImage calls now use 'JPEG' format. Downstream divider and ty positions adjusted to follow new logo bottom.

[LOG — 2026-04-26]
- Action: Restored StructureBuilder after the skip-it experiment broke geometry. Switched name matching from centroid to area signature.
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift
- Decision: StructureBuilder is load-bearing for wall merging — never skip it again. Without it, adjacent rooms render with parallel un-merged walls, hallway geometry extends into empty space, door swings float, and chain dim Z-line math fails. Centroid matching (matchNamesToStructuredRooms) failed every iteration; bounding-box area is more robust because StructureBuilder doesn't change room area meaningfully. New matchNamesByArea: compute bbox ft² for each captured + rebuilt room, greedy closest-area match, each captured used at most once. structureToRooms now takes [Int: (String, Int)] (name, scanIndex) and emits scanIndex in the room dict; buildStructure sorts output by scanIndex so PDF renders in scan order. StructureBuilder failure falls back to fallbackRooms (unmerged capturedRooms with inline names). showNamingScreen / nameFields / structuredRooms marked DEAD CODE.
- Open: If two rooms have very similar area (e.g. two bedrooms ~140sf each), area match may mis-pair. Watch the [LIDAR_NAME] console log — it prints rebuilt area, captured area, and delta for every match. If mis-pairing is detected, add centroid distance as a tiebreaker when delta < 5% of the smaller area.
