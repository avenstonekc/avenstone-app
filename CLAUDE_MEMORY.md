## Financial System Rebuild (2026-04-23 to 2026-04-25)

Complete rebuild of the financial data model and UI. All phases shipped. Reference FINANCIALS_PLAN.md for full architectural decisions and rollback plan.

### What shipped

**Bug fixes (pre-rebuild):**
- `paid_at` column missing from job_transactions — migration added + backfilled from created_at
- ai-pm-nightly Rule 2 checked `status='due'` (invalid enum) — fixed to `status='overdue' OR (status='pending' AND due_date < today)`
- COTab co_total computed client-side — DB trigger `trg_sync_co_total` now auto-updates jobs.co_total on every CO change
- Migration file: `20260423_financial_bug_fixes.sql`

**Phase 1 — Unified ledger:**
- `job_transactions` is single source of truth. payments + job_cost_invoices migrated in.
- Compat views `payments` and `job_cost_invoices` kept alive (SECURITY INVOKER, RLS enforces through them) — rollback path via `_deprecated_*_20260423` tables, keep until 2026-05-07 minimum
- `change_order_id` on job_transactions is TEXT (not UUID — change_orders.id is TEXT)
- New supabase.js helpers: sbLoadJobTransactions, sbCreateTransaction, sbUpdateTransaction, sbVoidTransaction, sbUploadReceipt (job-receipts bucket), sbUploadLienWaiverTx (job-documents/lien-waivers/)
- Migration file: `20260423_unified_financial_ledger.sql`

**Phase 3 — Financials tab (13→10 JobDet tabs):**
- New FinancialsTab.jsx with 5 sub-tabs: Ledger, Estimate, Budget, Change Orders, Costs
- TransactionModal.jsx — create/edit/view modes; 3-button segmented toggle (Paid/Pending/Draft) default; full status dropdown only for void/overdue/refunded
- Lien waiver badge on sub_payout/vendor_payment rows missing lien_waiver_url
- ai-pm-nightly Rule 7 (lien_waiver_missing), Rule 8 (budget_overrun >110%)
- ai-companion updated to read job_transactions
- Stat bar: Contract / Received / Client Owes / Paid Out / Outstanding

**Phase 4 — Budget vs Actual:**
- `estimate_line_items` table — GENERATED ALWAYS AS STORED columns: `total_cost = quantity * unit_cost`, `client_price = quantity * unit_cost * (1 + markup_pct/100)`. RLS: staff full access, client SELECT only on cost_plus jobs.
- `sbSaveEstimateLineItems` uses delete-then-insert (full replacement per job)
- `job_transactions.phase TEXT` added alongside `phase_id UUID FK` for free-text budget matching
- **job_phases column is `phase_name` (not `name`)** — critical for any query joining job_phases
- Budget matching: `t.phase.trim().toLowerCase() === li.phase.trim().toLowerCase()`
- Migrations: `20260423_estimate_line_items.sql`, `20260424_add_phase_text_to_transactions.sql`
- **Migration deployment method:** temp `run-migration` edge function using postgres.js via `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (auto-injected in hosted edge functions). Management API PAT only works for function deploys, NOT for DB queries.

**Phase 5 — QuickBooks CSV export:**
- `qb_category_map` table — `(tenant_id, tx_type)` UNIQUE. RLS: owner write, staff read. 12 seeded rows.
- `job_transactions.qb_synced_at TIMESTAMPTZ` — optional stamp after export
- `src/lib/qbExport.js` — QB bank CSV: Date MM/DD/YYYY, Amount (+in/-out), Account, Class, Customer (from `tx.job.client_name`), Vendor (from `payer_or_payee_name`, fallback: `"Sub Payout - unnamed"`), Memo, Job. RFC 4180 escaping. void+draft skipped.
- Export modal in Ledger: date range (This Month/Quarter/YTD/All/Custom), all-jobs scope (owner only), mark-synced checkbox; "Hide Synced" toggle in filter bar
- Settings → QuickBooks tab (owner only): editable table of 12 tx types → QB Account/Class, auto-saves on blur
- `sbLoadTransactionsForExport` joins `job:jobs(address,client_name)` for multi-job exports
- Migration: `20260425_qb_category_map.sql`

**Phase 6 — Field tab consolidation (10→8 tabs):**
- New `FieldTab.jsx` — thin wrapper with sub-tabs: Notes & Photos / Daily Logs / Materials
- Notes + Photos combined into one sub-tab (were two separate top-level tabs)
- Consultation tab (id=`session`) was rendering in JobDet but missing from TABS array — surfaced in tab bar
- Final JobDet tab order: Info, Financials, Schedule, Field, Messages, Documents, Scanner, Consultation
- No changes to NotesPhotosTab, LogsTab, or MaterialsTab
- Completion banner "Go to Photos →" updated from `setTab('photos')` → `setTab('field')`

### Locked architectural decisions
- `job_transactions` is the single financial source of truth — no parallel tables
- `cost_plus` is a client-visibility flag only — all jobs track costs internally regardless
- Lien waivers are warnings, not hard blocks — transaction saves without them
- Commissions are transactions (`type='commission'`, `direction='out'`)
- Retainage fields present on job_transactions (`retainage_pct`, `retainage_held`) — no UI yet

## Session log

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: CORRECTION — AiIntakeWizard was claimed to support LiDAR toggle but never did. Completely rewrote as pure LiDAR scanning flow — removed AI chat step, manual grid, review/submit step, lead creation. New wizard is a thin wrapper rendering LidarScanner fullscreen.
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/components/ai/AiIntakeWizard.jsx (full rewrite), src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (fixed async isLidarSupported bug)
- Decision: Path A — scanned rooms held in local state only for now. Lead creation + save-to-job return in a later phase.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: Phase 1 LiDAR confirmed on iPhone 17 Pro. Locked LiDAR roadmap Phases 2-4.
- Decision: Scans attach to contacts first (not jobs directly). Phase 2 = continuous multi-room session (~1,500 sqft limit). Phase 4 = wing editor + GPS-anchored stitching.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: LiDAR scan persistence shipped — scans attach to jobs (FloorPlanTab) and contacts (ContactsScr)
- Files: supabase.js (+sbSaveJobLidarScan, sbGetJobLidarScans, sbSaveLidarScan, sbGetContactLidarScans), FloorPlanTab.jsx (new), ContactsScr.jsx (+floor plans card), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (+jobId prop)
- Decision: Both tables use TEXT FK (not UUID) — contacts.id and jobs.id are TEXT type. FK constraint on UUID type would fail.

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: AI PM Dashboard built — owner-only, 30-day nightly alert history with stat cards and alert breakdown
- Files: components/dashboard/AiPmDashboard.jsx (new), App.jsx (+nav item + render, owner-only)

[LOG — 2026-04-15]
- Action: Sub portal upgrade gap analysis — PM-Sub direct chat, phase confirmation, CO submission are all missing
- Decision: Sub AI companion replaced with PM-Sub direct chat concept. Phase confirmation (mark started/complete) and sub CO submission spec'd but not built.
- Open: Sub phase buttons (Mark Started / Mark Complete) may silently fail on device if RLS doesn't allow sub UPDATE on job_phases — one-line migration fix if needed.

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 1 shipped — CaptureMode enum, expanded data model, GPS stamping
- Files: src/lib/gps.js (new), supabase.js (sbSaveJobLidarScan + sbSaveLidarScan updated), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (GPS wired in), Info.plist (NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription)
- DB: job_lidar_scans + contact_lidar_scans both get 10 new nullable columns: capture_mode (default 'interior'), height_meters, height_source, height_points[], gps_latitude, gps_longitude, gps_accuracy, quality_score, quality_grade, quality_deductions (JSONB)

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 2 shipped — Exterior Mode AR capture (ARKit, not RoomPlan — LiDAR fails outdoors)
- Files: ExteriorScanViewController.swift (new), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (+startExteriorScan), src/lib/lidar.js (+startExteriorScan), LidarScanner.jsx (mode toggle), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (exterior save paths), FloorPlanTab.jsx (exterior scan card)
- Decision: Tap corners → gold spheres + cylinder lines. Shoelace formula for area. Long press to drag corners. outline_data JSONB column stores result. capture_mode='exterior' distinguishes in UI.

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 3 shipped — mandatory height capture on all captures, both modes
- Files: src/components/ai/HeightCaptureStep.jsx (new — shared confirm/override UI), ExteriorScanViewController.swift (height phase after polygon Done, groundY from corner average, tap-to-raycast), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (added 'height' step, all save paths include height fields), FloorPlanTab.jsx (amber 'Height missing' badge on legacy records)
- Decision: Interior autoHeightFt = max of room.height values. Height is mandatory — Confirm disabled until valid. No skip path.

[LOG — 2026-04-19]
- Action: Capture v2 Phase 4 shipped — quality meter 0-100, live bar in Swift VCs, post-capture report in React
- Files: CaptureQualityTracker.swift (new — shared scoring class), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (live quality bar), ExteriorScanViewController.swift (live bar), src/components/ai/CaptureQualityReport.jsx (new — score/deductions/Re-scan+Accept), AiIntakeWizard.jsx (added 'report' step)
- Decision: Interior live bar = duration-based (20→90 over 60s). Final score from CapturedRoom (wall count, confidence, ceiling, duration, area). Aggregate quality = average of per-room scores. Quality saves regardless of Re-scan or Accept.

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Reconciled CLAUDE.md Priority Order and Done list against actual shipped code
- Files: CLAUDE.md (Priority Order + Done section rewritten, model string updated to claude-opus-4-7)
- Decision: Priority Order: fixtures/objects export → PDF dimension overhaul → LiDAR Phase 4 wing editor → sub portal upgrades → white-label wizard → lien waivers

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Fixtures/objects export shipped — Swift serialization + JS PDF rendering
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift (+fixtureCategoryString, +objectSegs loop in roomToDict and structureToRooms), src/lib/pdf.js (+FIXTURE_LABELS, +_drawFixture, +render loop)
- Decision: fixtureCategoryString uses if-equality (not switch) — CapturedRoom.Object.Category is a struct, not an enum.
- Decision: Render 9 categories (toilet, bathtub, sink, stove, oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, washerDryer, storage). Skip furniture + unknown. Confidence .low skipped.
- Decision: Single-room path objects exported from Swift but NOT rendered in JS PDF yet — _processWalls rotates rooms for layout but object coords from roomToDict are in unrotated ARKit space. Rotation transform deferred to Phase 2.
- Open: Single-room fixture rendering requires passing rotation angle from _processWalls to _drawFixture.

[LOG — 2026-04-22]
- Action: Track B architecture review + full codebase cleanup + sub portal and PDF features shipped
- Files (cleanup): deleted lib/ai.js, lib/captureTypes.js, App.css, src/styles/, dead assets. Renamed SubOnboardingModal → SubComplianceModal. Centralized hardcoded Supabase URLs across 10 files into supabase.js.
- Files (pdf.js): Proper architectural dimension lines replacing W×D bounding-box text. _drawDimLine helper with extension lines, tick marks, outward-normal offset. W×D label removed from centroid.
- Files (sub portal): supabase.js (+sbSubUpdatePhase, +sbSubSubmitCO), SubJobView.jsx (Mark Started/Complete buttons, CO submission form).
- Decision: AV_JOBS / setGlobalJobs kept — FormScr.jsx uses AV_JOBS for job picker. Not dead.
- Decision: ConsultationTab split and LidarScanner split rejected as premature — only worth doing when a feature forces us back in.

[LOG — 2026-04-23]
- Action: Fixed Playwright Step 8 flaky test + ContractModal iOS "Load failed" + ClientPortal contract banner + codemagic.yaml Beta Review bug
- Files: tests/portals-e2e.spec.js (reactFill() + waitForTimeout(2500) for sbNotify DB write), ContractModal.jsx (signed_url || file_url), ClientPortal.jsx (contract banner), codemagic.yaml (submit_to_testflight: false)
- Decision: page.fill() doesn't reliably trigger React onChange on controlled inputs — always use reactFill() helper in tests.
- Decision: proposalDoc.file_url is raw storage path; inside Capacitor webview resolves to localhost — use signed_url.
- Decision: submit_to_testflight: true with no beta_groups triggers Beta App Review. Internal testers only — set false.

[LOG — 2026-04-23]
- Action: Fixed multi-room LiDAR room-name off-by-one bug + 5 floor plan PDF renderer improvements
- Files: RoomPlanPlugin.swift (removed between-scan room picker, all N names entered at end with sqft hints)
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (feet-inches format 5'-6", perimeter-only dim lines, door arc cap, 3-tier wall weights, _drawFixture icon rewrite)
- Decision: Root cause of off-by-one — StructureBuilder returns rooms in spatial order (not scan order). Fix: one naming screen at the end, no mid-session picker.
- Decision: Wall weights: exterior 2.5pt, interior/shared 1.5pt, door/window 0.5pt. Uses midCount map to classify.
- Open: Verify perimeter-only dim lines on device — depends on StructureBuilder returning shared walls in both adjacent room lists.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Consolidated on request — financial rebuild (Phases 1-6) compressed into single block. Live backlog: Phase 7 receipt vision (deferred), IA cleanup, sub financial visibility, notifications audit.

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Professional PDF renderer rewrite — full architectural floor plan, multi-floor support, poché walls, world-mode vs packing-mode layout, polygon centroid labels, graduated scale bar
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (full rewrite: added _groupByFloor, _dedupFeatures, _segsToPolyPoints, _polyCentroid, _pointInPoly, _interiorPoint, _drawPoché, _eraseGap, _dimLine, _drawScaleBar, _renderFloorPage, _renderSummaryPage; removed FIXTURE_LABELS/_drawFixture), src/lib/captureTypes.js (re-created: FLOOR_LABELS, floorLabel — was deleted 2026-04-22)
- Decision: Fixture rendering deliberately removed. Single-room path requires rotation transform from _processWalls that doesn't exist yet. Deferred to next phase.
- Decision: Landscape orientation (792×612pt) for floor plan pages; summary page stays portrait.
- Decision: World-mode (has worldX/worldZ) → _processAllRooms + spatial layout. Single-room fallback → _processWalls packing layout.
- Open: Fixture rendering pending — Swift already serializes room.objects; PDF needs _drawFixture reinstated with correct rotation transform.

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Multi-floor scan flow wired end-to-end — captureTypes.js, floorIndex JS→Swift→rooms, floor picker screen in LidarScanner
- Files: src/lib/captureTypes.js (FLOOR_LABELS, floorLabel), src/lib/lidar.js (scanMultipleRooms(floorIndex), simulation rooms tagged with floor field), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (floorIndex from JS call → vc.floorIndex → "floor" in room dicts), src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (FloorPicker component, FLOOR_OPTIONS, computeNextFloor, pendingFloorIndex state), CLAUDE.md (+commit-and-push Working Preference bullet)
- Decision: Floor picker skipped on first scan (rooms empty) — auto-uses floor 0. Shown before every subsequent scan. Auto-selects next unscanned floor.
- Decision: FLOOR_LABELS: -1=Basement, 0=1st Floor, 1=2nd Floor, 2=3rd Floor, 3=4th Floor. Legacy rooms without floor field default to 0.

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: 13-bug PDF cleanup sweep (Bugs 1–13) — architectural floor plan renderer polish across pdf.js and RoomPlanPlugin.swift
- Files: src/lib/pdf.js (13 commits), RoomPlanPlugin.swift (Bug 7 — polygon containment name matching)
- Decision: Bug 2 — interior wall classification replaced: 3-condition test (midpoint ≤0.5ft + length ±15% + direction |dot|≥0.9) instead of midpoint-only quantized grid. Eliminates false bathroom interior dim.
- Decision: Bug 7 — Swift name match: wall endpoints sorted by angle from centroid → polygon; pointInPolygon as primary; nearest-centroid fallback with [LIDAR_WARN] log.
- Decision: Overall bounding dims (top + right) at off=62, lw=1.0 — heavier than per-wall dims (off=44, lw=0.75).
- Decision: Title block moved to left-side vertical column (TC_W=108pt). Plan area now 536×476pt inside DL=168/DR=704/DT=82/DB=558.
- Decision: Overall HEIGHT dim on RIGHT side — left side is blocked by title column.

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Second PDF + scanner cleanup sweep — Bugs 1–10 (commits 4f46f29 through f517802)
- Files: src/components/ai/LidarScanner.jsx (Bug 1), src/lib/pdf.js (Bugs 2–10)

**Audit findings:**
- Bug 1 (floor picker not firing): ListPhase was calling onStartMultiRoomScan(0) directly when rooms.length===0, bypassing FloorPicker. Also computeNextFloor iterated [-1,0,1,2,3] so empty rooms defaulted to Basement. Fix: always route through onOpenFloorPicker; reordered preference to [0,1,2,3,-1].
- Bug 3 (landscape): jsPDF({ format: [792,612] }) without explicit orientation was being interpreted inconsistently. Fix: orientation:'landscape' + format:'letter'.
- Bug 7 (duplicate dims): Two exterior segs from different rooms with slightly different outward-normal normalizations gave different `dist` values, causing the placedDims dedup to miss them. Resolved by chain-dim rewrite — per-edge grouping dedupes by midpoint proximity (0.3 ft) before rendering.
- Bug 8 (TOTAL row): gTotPerim and gTotWallArea were never declared at global scope (only floor-level fTotPerim/fTotWallArea existed). TOTAL row hardcoded '—' for all three. Fix: added global accumulators, wired roll-up, ceiling total = floor area total.
- Bug 10 (openings): Openings loop already correct — erase only, no swing arc. Walk-through rendered with swing arc = RoomPlan sensor tagged it as CapturedRoom.Door, not Opening. Render-side fix not applicable. Flagged as known limitation; user-editable override deferred.

**Key decisions:**
- Chain dims (Bug 5): MagicPlan style — one dim line per edge (top/bottom/right), single label per segment centered on span, tick marks at each boundary, overall outer tier at +38pt. Left edge skipped (title column).
- Bug 4 (left-edge overlap into title column): Resolved by omitting left chain entirely.
- Bug 2 (orthogonal snap): _snapToOrtho runs on a deep clone before _processAllRooms. Angle snap (5° tolerance) + endpoint merge (2-inch tolerance). Raw data preserved.
- Bug 6 (label collision): _renderChainDims returns label bounding boxes; room labels check dimBoxes + previously placed room label boxes before rendering. Falls back to interior point, then font reduction 10%, then [LIDAR_WARN].
- Bug 9 (garage door): ri preserved on door objects via byRoom() to look up room name. Width ≥6ft + /garage/i room name → overhead-door symbol (two parallel lines + inward arrow). Width 4–6ft non-garage → bi-fold unchanged. <4ft → swing arc unchanged.

**Known remaining limitations:**
- RoomPlan misclassification of walk-through openings as doors (Bug 10 — sensor-side, not render-side)
- Fixture/object rendering still pending rotation transform (_drawFixture not yet reinstated)
- Single-room (non-world-mode) path: chain dims not applied (still uses old per-seg _dimLine calls)

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Read-only audit — Material Takeoff Wizard design. Covered 6 areas: scan data shape, pdf.js takeoff math, AI estimate flow, ai_knowledge pricing, estimate_line_items schema, MaterialSelectionScr.
- Files: None changed (read-only audit)
- Decision: MaterialSelectionScr (950 lines) is not a foundation — it writes to jobs.intake_answers only, uses hardcoded formulas, not connected to scan data or estimate_line_items. Start fresh.
- Decision: `generate-estimate-from-session` IS reachable from UI — ConsultationTab calls it from the "Generate Estimate" button. It does NOT write estimate_line_items; caller (ConsultationTab.saveEstimate) handles persistence. [Corrected: prior claim of "orphaned" was wrong.]
- Decision: estimate_line_items schema is well-designed (quantity + unit + unit_cost → generated total_cost + client_price). Zero rows in production — ready to receive takeoff output.
- Decision: ai_knowledge has 21 total entries — 15 pricing/rule, 6 narrative. All active. Content is structured prose with $ ranges, regex-extractable but not machine-readable JSON. [Corrected: prior claim of "8 entries" was wrong.]
- Decision: Recommended build path — (1) extract computeTakeoff(rooms) from pdf.js, (2) generateLineItems(takeoff, selections) → estimate_line_items rows, (3) wizard UI room-by-room material selection, (4) summary + estimate PDF.
- Next: Build Material Takeoff Wizard starting with Phase 1 (data extraction layer)

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: Read-only audit — Scope-and-allowance engine design. Second audit expanding on first. Covered: consultation_sessions/extractions/measurements schema, session write flow, consultation↔scan join, generate-estimate-from-session full code, ai-estimator full code, their difference, callEstimator existence check, estimate_line_items extension surface, MaterialSelectionScr deep read, ai_knowledge full dump + machine-readability, change_orders schema, upgrade-CO column gap analysis.
- Files: None changed (read-only audit)
- Decision: consultation_sessions + job_lidar_scans share only job_id — NO structural join. Two parallel data pools.
- Decision: generate-estimate-from-session IS reachable from UI (ConsultationTab). Previous session's audit was wrong about it being orphaned. It's called from "Generate Estimate" button.
- Decision: ai-estimator (EstimateTab chat) and generate-estimate-from-session (ConsultationTab measure flow) serve different stages — not redundant.
- Decision: estimate_line_items has NO allowance column, NO scan_id, NO template_id. notes (TEXT) is the only free extension field. Full replace-all write pattern via sbSaveEstimateLineItems.
- Decision: MaterialSelectionScr is hardcoded bathroom-only with picsum photos. APPROX_QTY is static (tile=200sf regardless of scan). buildEstimate() uses fixed per-sqft ratios. Writes to jobs.intake_answers only. Dead code — not imported anywhere.
- Decision: ai_knowledge pricing entries are machine-parseable prose ranges (regex extractable), not JSON. 15 pricing/rule entries, 6 narrative entries. All active. Mid-range formula: (low+high)/2.
- Decision: change_orders has no FK to estimate_line_items. No allowance_original, no estimate_line_item_id, no auto_generated, no client_approved_at, no source_type. All 6 would be needed for auto-CO from client upgrade selection.
- Open: ai_knowledge pricing entries need a parsing pass or a new structured pricing_lookup table before they can be used as machine-readable unit costs in a takeoff engine.
- Next: Design scope-and-allowance engine schema (new tables: scan_takeoff, allowance_line_items or estimate_line_items extension, upgrade_selections) before writing any code.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: Read-only audit delivered — scope-and-allowance engine (second audit, full briefing). All 6 areas covered and reported to user.
- Files: None changed (read-only audit)
- Decision: Briefing confirmed — consultation↔scan join is job_id only (no structural link). generate-estimate-from-session IS reachable from UI. estimate_line_items has no allowance/scan/template columns. MaterialSelectionScr writes to jobs.intake_answers only, not imported anywhere. ai_knowledge has 15 pricing entries (regex-parseable prose ranges) + 6 narrative. change_orders needs 6 new columns for auto-CO flow: estimate_line_item_id, allowance_original, allowance_override, source_type, auto_generated, client_approved_at.

[LOG — 2026-04-24]
- Action: PDF generation bug fixed — silent crash on tap "Generate PDF" across commits 4f46f29–f517802
- Files: avenstone-vite/src/lib/pdf.js
- Decision: Root cause — `_renderChainDims` line 551 returned `undefined` instead of `[]` when `kept` (post-dedup segment array) was empty. Callers spread the return value (`..._renderChainDims(...)`); spreading `undefined` threw a TypeError that silently killed the render with no user-visible error. Fix: `return;` → `return [];`.
- Decision: Added try/catch wrapping all of `buildFloorPlanPDF` — `console.error('[LIDAR_PDF_ERROR]', e)` + `alert()` with message on failure. User now sees an error instead of silence.
- Decision: Added `[LIDAR_PDF_STAGE]` breadcrumbs at: start, groupByFloor, doc created, per-floor page (with floor name), snapToOrtho, processAllRooms, chain dims, room labels, summary page, complete. Use Safari Web Inspector / Xcode console to read these on device.
- Open: Awaiting `[LIDAR_PDF_ERROR]` / `[LIDAR_PDF_STAGE]` output from next user scan to confirm fix held or identify any secondary crash path.
- Next: If PDF renders cleanly — proceed to scope-and-allowance engine schema design.

[LOG — 2026-04-25]
- Action: AVENSTONE_VISION.md updated — 11 targeted edits adding multi-owner model, AI-seeded inspection checklists, expanded moat section, and cost guardrail rule.
- Files: AVENSTONE_VISION.md
- Decision: (a) Multi-owner model — all owners equivalent, first-to-approve wins on CO/knowledge/contract actions. No second signature. Each owner gets their own morning brief.
- Decision: (b) Per-user briefings are not consolidated — each user sees a brief based on their own job touches, not a shared owner dashboard.
- Decision: (c) Inspection checklists — AI-seeded baseline (one Sonnet call, 60-80 entries, owner approves before activation). v2 ai_knowledge_learner edge function suggests new entries from completed job patterns; owner approves each addition. inspection_checklist open question closed — decision made.
- Decision: (d) Moat section expanded with three durable advantages: runs the software it builds (uncopyable feedback loop), every job teaches the system (private dataset compounds), single-builder velocity (idea Mon → ship Fri).
